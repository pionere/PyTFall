    # BaseBuilding = Base class, needed if no other.
    # FamousBuilding = Adds fame and reputation mechanics to the building.
    # BuildingStats = Adds dirt and cleaning to the building.
    # UpgradableBuilding = Adds upgrades  to the building.
    #
    # Examples:
    # class CityJail(Building): <-- Just a building
    # class Brothel(UpgradableBuilding, BuildingStats, FamousBuilding): <-- A building will upgrade, dirt and fame mechanics.

            *Generates Clients if required.
            *Builds worker lists.
            *Logs the init data to the building report.
            *Runs pre_day for all businesses.
            *Creates SimPy Environment and runs it (run_jobs being the main controlling process)
            *Runs the post_nd.
        building_manager():
            SimPy process that manages the building as a whole.

            *Builds a list of all workable businesses.
            *Starts business_manager for each building.
        clients_manager():
            SimPy Process that supplies clients to the businesses within the building as required.
            *Adds a steady/conditioned stream of clients to the appropriate businesses and manages that stream:
            *Kicks clients if nothing could be arranged for them.

    BUSINESS:
        # Hold all data/methods required for business to operate.
        *Personal Service:
            - Finds best client match using update.get_workers()
            - Runs the job.
        *Public Service:
            - Simply sends client to business.
            - Sends in Workers to serve/entertain the clients.
        *OnDemand Service:
            - Includes some form of "on demand" service, like cleaning or guarding (defending).
            - May also have a continued, "automatic" service like Guard-patrol.

        *workers = On duty characters.
        *habitable/workable = self-explanotory.
        *clients = clients used locally (maybe useful only for the public service?)
        *capacity = cap of the building such as amount of rooms/workspace.
        *jobs = only for businesses
        *get_workers:
            - Checks if a char is capable.
            - Checks if a char is willing.
            - Can also try to match find the best client for the job.

            *request_resource:
                - requests a room for worker/client.
                - adds a run_job process to Env
                - logs it all to building log
            *run_job:
                - Waits for self.time delay
                - Calls the job so it can form an NDEvent

        *Public Service:
            *active_workers = Does this not simply double the normal workers?
            *request = plainly adds a client and keeps it in the business based on "ready_to_leave" flag set directly to the client.
            *add_worker:
                # Adds workers to business to serve clients.
                - Checks willingness to do the job.
                - Adds workers as required.
                - self.env.process(self.worker_control(worker)) Possible the most important part, this adds a process to Env.
                - Removes worker from building in order to reserve her for this business
            *run_job:
                # main method/SimPy event that manages the job from start to end.
                - Runs for as long there are active workers
                - Waits for self.time delay
                - Manages clients in the business
            *worker_control:
                # Env Process, manages each individual worker.
                - Runs while there are clients and worker has AP in self.time delays.
                - Logs all active clients as flags to a worker.
                - Logs tips to the worker.
                - Runs the Job once AP had been exhausted or there are no more clients availible.
                - Removes the worker from active workers
