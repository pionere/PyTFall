    ## This lets you change the placement of the main menu.

    ## The way placement works is that we find an anchor point
    ## inside a displayable, and a position (pos) point on the
    ## screen. We then place the displayable so the two points are
    ## at the same place.

    ## An anchor/pos can be given as an integer or a floating point
    ## number. If an integer, the number is interpreted as a number
    ## of pixels from the upper-left corner. If a floating point,
    ## the number is interpreted as a fraction of the size of the
    ## displayable or screen.

    ##     Matches all characters, including the directory separator.
    ##
    ## For example:
    ##
    ## *.txt
    ##     Matches txt files in the base directory.
    ## game/**.ogg
    ##     Matches ogg files in the game directory or any of its subdirectories.
    ## **.psd
    ##    Matches psd files anywhere in the project.
