PyTFall is an open source (turnbased) game with a Hentai twist similar to WM, SimBro, SM focusing on 
gathering a team of workers, managing businesses, leveling up the MC and other characters and interacting with the latter,
fighting in the arena, exploring the city and etc.

Modules currently include:

- FF Style Battle Engine
- Arena

- Interactions
- Businesses (Fighters Guild, StripClub, Cafe and Brothel)
- Quests tracker
- Events tracker
- Items/Inventory/Shops system
- Advanced Characters (Random and Unique) system with many Stats, Traits and Skills
- MC with background stories/Setup Screen
- Schools
- Jail

In the last few month a lot of work has been on interface and adding content to some of the modules
as well as recoding part of the game. Other modules are planned or actively developed.
